## Short description

### What's the problem?

If a teacher fails to teach justice to his student, the teacher is fake; if a judge fails to provide justice to his countrymen, the judge is fake; if a country fails to seek justice to its citizen, the country is fake. Who is fake? A raindrop remains pure until it doesnâ€™t fall on the earth.

We cannot expect people to have respect for law and order until we teach respect to those we have entrusted to enforce those laws.

And the sad reality is that, we currently live in an environment where desired authorities interactions with People in case of mis-happenings disproportionately end in unnecessary and avoidable escalation.

Also, the charges we pay to the authorities in order to seek help and understand the Rights we have and steps we should take in case of any mis-happenings. 


### How can technology help?

Legal awareness, is the empowerment of individuals regarding issues involving the law. Legal awareness helps to promote consciousness of legal culture, participation in the formation of laws and the rule of law 
Our platform will provide a right direction to the people by posting the incidents they  went through ,suggest way to tackle them  and seek solutions to the problems they are currently facing .
The idea is to empower communities by capturing similar kind of injustice faced by people around us. The goal is to create a solution that could aid in the avoidance and de-escalation of incidents, and provide visibility and opportunities for people to come up and support others with the experience they gained while tackling the same issue.

## The architecture

![Video transcription/translation app](https://developer.ibm.com/developer/tutorials/cfc-starter-kit-speech-to-text-app-example/images/cfc-covid19-remote-education-diagram-2.png)

1. The user navigates to the site and uploads a video file.
2. Watson Speech to Text processes the audio and extracts the text.
3. Watson Translation (optionally) can translate the text to the desired language.
4. The app stores the translated text as a document within Object Storage.

## Project roadmap

We are building an app where people will share their as well as social problems, will learn about the various human rights in a desirable time and with no cost.
-It will inspire people to shed light on this issue and provide them a starting point to handle difficult situations/incidents.
-It will encourage members of the public to capture incidents that might otherwise go unwitnessed.
-Display patterns and correlations of incidents that can be grouped by time, location, and type to better understand the scenario.
